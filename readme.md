Learning Dokku
==============

This repository is being used as a simple project to deploy to [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) or any provider that will deploy a Procfile based environment, like Heroku.

Why not use the nodejs app in the Dokku readme? Because.

Things to test out
------------------

[ ] Dokku Postgres Plugin
[ ] Running DB Migrations on Deploy
[ ] Running Procfile workers (multiple processes)
